This repository contains all the necessary resources to reproduce the CETA mixed reality environment from scratch. 


Here you can find de mirror and holder designs in .dxf and the links to 1) computer vision module to detect the augmented rods, 2) Android CETA game. 

Soon we will complete this information in order to make the whole environment easily reproducible. 

If you have any questions about the development of the game, vision module or hardware design reach us at:
